Feathernodes is a port of Bitnodes which is currently being developed to estimate the size of the Bitcoin network by finding all the reachable nodes in the network. The current methodology involves sending [getaddr](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification#getaddr) messages recursively to find all the reachable nodes in the network, starting from a set of seed nodes. Feathernodes uses Feathercoin protocol version 70015 (i.e. >= /Feathercoin:0.13.x/), so nodes running an older protocol version will be skipped.

See [Provisioning Bitcoin Network Crawler](https://github.com/ayeowch/bitnodes/wiki/Provisioning-Bitcoin-Network-Crawler) for steps on setting up a machine to run Bitnodes. The [Redis Data](https://github.com/ayeowch/bitnodes/wiki/Redis-Data) contains the list of keys and their associated values that are written by the scripts in this project.
